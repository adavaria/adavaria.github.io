subtitle: AI Engineer and Researcher
---

Hello! I'm Ali Davariashtiyani, a machine learning engineer and researcher specializing in materials science. I'm thrilled to be part of the AI community during this era of rapid progress in deep learning. 

I have a PhD in Materials Engineering from the University of Illinois Chicago. My dissertation focused on using machine learning and deep learning to predict synthesizability and formation energy of novel materials. I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest AI research by reading papers on ArXiv and OpenReview.

Professionally, I have experience applying deep learning techniques to materials science problems, including:

- Representing crystal structures as 3D voxel images for input to convolutional neural networks
- Developing models to predict whether a given crystal structure can be synthesized
- Estimating formation energies of crystals to aid in materials discovery

I have also worked on high performance computing systems and am comfortable with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Slurm, and HTCondor.

Outside of materials science, I have worked on deep learning projects in natural language processing, finance, and automotive navigation. I enjoy implementing cutting-edge algorithms to solve real-world problems.

Overall, I am passionate about leveraging AI advancements to push the boundaries of what's possible. I look forward to contributing to the field throughout my career.
